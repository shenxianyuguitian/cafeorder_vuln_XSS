Proof-of-Concept and Advisory for Simple Cafe Ordering System XSS

# Vulnerability Advisory & Exploit

## Affected Version
Simple Cafe Ordering System (version details not provided)

---

## Vulnerability Type
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected XSS

---

## Advisory (Recommendations)

### Sanitize Output
Use functions like `htmlspecialchars()` to encode output and prevent executing HTML or JavaScript code.

### Input Validation
Validate user inputs rigorously for allowed characters and patterns, particularly in critical fields like product names and user names.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
Apply a strict Content Security Policy to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts.

### Escaping Dynamic Content
Ensure that dynamic content, such as images and user data (e.g., `$_SESSION['SESS_FIRST_NAME']`), is always sanitized before rendering on the page.

### Use Secure Headers
Ensure proper HTTP headers are set, such as `X-XSS-Protection` and `X-Content-Type-Options`.

## Proof-of-Concept (Exploit)

### Exploit Steps:

1. **Intercept HTTP Request**
   Use a proxy tool like Burp Suite or Fiddler to intercept the HTTP request.

2. **Modify Payload**
   Inject a malicious JavaScript payload in the input fields (e.g., product name, username) in the POST request.
   
**Example payload:**
     
     "><script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Exploit');</script>

3. **Submit the Modified Request**
   Modify and forward the request to the server. When the page is rendered, the injected JavaScript will execute in the context of the other user’s browser.

4. **Verify Impact:**
   Ensure the injected script runs on the victim’s browser, indicating a successful XSS attack.

**Example Payload:**
    
    "><script>alert('XSS Vulnerability Exploit');</script>
